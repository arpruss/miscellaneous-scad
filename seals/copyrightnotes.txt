The original point clouds were licensed CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0/DE, but of course the 
original seals have been in the public domain for millennia, and I believe a 
mere 3D scan does not add copyright. But I am not a lawyer, and European law 
may be different, so I hereby put the CC-BY-NC-SA notice on these files just 
to avoid trouble. However, I am not myself claiming any copyright on any of 
the transformations I made of the point cloud, so if point clouds of ancient 
objects have no copyright, the files posted here have no copyright either.
